* everybody understands
* we are given a task
* let's google the question
* voila!
* what if somebody gave us a similar task?
* perfect!

* somebody told us about functions in Python
* function in maths: input -> output, nothing else matters
* Python: similar, implementation matters
* let's code! does anybody see a problem here?
* no return - changing the argument; it's a bit tricky - what is passed by ref,
  what is passed by value

* pure: input is in arguments, output is in result
* dirty: everything else
* let's recall the meeting with Hubert
* what was the problem? why didn't we catch it?
* change the system date; or test internal functions; or turn the date into an
  argument
* we can test on any day of the week

* scripts as POOR functions
* don't return the result this way

* easy homework for practice
